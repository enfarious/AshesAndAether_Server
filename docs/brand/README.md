# Ashes & Aether Brand Assets

## Files

- `docs/brand/ashes-and-aether-logo.svg` - Wordmark + emblem + subtitle
- `docs/brand/ashes-and-aether-mark.svg` - Emblem-only mark

## Notes

- The emblem represents the Shatterline: a ruptured seam with ember glow.
- Colors lean ash/ember of death, blue/green of life, mellow and matte rather than neon; this matches the city-state vs wasteland contrast.
- Fonts in SVG are suggestions (Cinzel / IM FELL English SC / Space Grotesk). Fallbacks are included.
