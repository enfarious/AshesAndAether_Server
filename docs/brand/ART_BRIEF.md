# Ashes & Aether Brand Mark Brief

## Core Title

**Ashes & Aether: Life on the Shatterline**

## One‑Line Pitch

Supernatural meets cyberpunk in a post‑apocalyptic upstate NY where a rift (“The Shatterline”) bleeds anomalies into the world.

## Canon Paragraph (Aether)

Aether gives life and power, but humans are greedy. Once we found it, we refused to stop taking.
The planet screamed. The war ended. The devastation was undeniable. Now we live in the ruins of our own creating.

The Shatterline is a stable source of the power we use for everything now. Aether was never meant for humans
to so directly manipulate. It corrupts. Tech learned to curb and channel the corruption, while nanotech lets some
touch Aether safely (mages). Others change — werewolves, vampires, elves, trolls, and worse.
Most begin human, then become something else by necessity.

## Visual Vibe

- Earthy, ritual, mythic — but scarred by advanced tech.
- Organic + supernatural vs. containment tech and force‑fields.
- City‑states behind hard‑tech walls; wastelands are lethal and alive.
- Nature is smarter and more dangerous (dire, mutated fauna).

## Mark Direction (Primary)

Totem / spirit‑animal motif corrupted by aether and wrapped in tech strands.

Desired cues:

- Old native totem style (stacked, carved forms).
- Spirit animals (owl/wolf/serpent/raven — pick 1‑2).
- Aether corruption (glow veins, fractures, warped geometry).
- Tech containment (cables, lattice, circuit wraps, energy binds).
- No generic “rift squiggle.” Needs readable silhouette.

## Wordmark Direction

Refined, readable serif with a subtle arcane flavor. Subtitle smaller:
**Life on the Shatterline**

## Palette Seed

- Ash: `#EEE6DA`
- Ember: `#D97A45`
- Coal: `#3A2A24`
- Ink: `#1D1412`

## Usage

- Game logo (website, launcher, splash).
- Emblem mark (favicon, app icon, social).
- In‑world signage (pubs, caravans, wanted posters).

## Deliverables

- Vector mark (SVG/AI).
- Wordmark (SVG/AI).
- Optional combined lockup (mark + wordmark + subtitle).

## Notes

- “Shatterline” is an in‑world concept (the rift), not the product name.
- We are avoiding overlap with existing “World of Darkness” branding.

## Reference Style (Ref_01)

Target the feel of `docs/brand/Ref_01.png`:
- Stacked totem with owl + wolf, central vertical rift seam.
- Dual energy split: ember/orange vs teal/blue (Ashes vs Aether).
- Tech wrap should feel structural (binding/caging the corruption).
- **More ritual *and* tech together**, not separate variants.

## Additional References

- `docs/brand/Totem in Rift.png`
  - Keep: ember/teal split down the rift, tech-wrapped totem, ash/stone texture.
  - Avoid: overly glossy sci-fi surfaces.
- `docs/brand/Totems Hold the Line.png`
  - Keep: city-state + energy tether concept (fortified line).
  - Note: the skyline is future-fantasy; use it for mood, not literal scale.
